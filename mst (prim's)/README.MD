### Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree

This program implements Prim's MST using Java's Priority Queue and modified node classes from directory `/bfs & dfs`. Program currently runs on one graph. Will refactor this so that custom graphs can be input by user.

### Run 

To run this program, compile `Main.java` with `javac`. Alternatively, this can
be run in your IDE of choice.
