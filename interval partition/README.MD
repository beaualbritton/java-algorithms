### Interval Partitioning Algorithm

This program implements a greedy interval partitioning algorithm. In the code, 'jobs' are represented as 'classrooms' with 'lectyres'. Refactor is planned so that code reflects 'jobs' and 'tasks' instead.

### Run 

To run this program, compile `Main.java` with `javac`. Alternatively, this can
be run in your IDE of choice.
