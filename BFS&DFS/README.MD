### DFS & BFS 

This program implements BFS and DFS in Java with an adjacency list as the primary data structure.

Currently, custom graphs are not supported. I intend to add this later.

### Run 

To run this program, compile the `Main.java` with `javac`. Alternatively, this can
be run in your IDE of choice.
